Module 4 Assignment Part 1 - Object Detection through Correlation-Based Template Matching

The purpose of this script is to detect a given 
object (template) within an image (scene). For this 
part of the assignment, OpenCV's template matching 
functionality has been used. There were issues with 
identification due to the lighting differences between 
template and scene. As such I had to use OpenCV's normalized 
cross correlation mapping for getting accurate correlation scores.

Usage:
	1. Run the script - python module2_part1.py
    2. Enter the file path of the scene image
    3. Enter the file path of template image
    4. Script will save an output image with a 
       box drawn around the detected object if found

Notes:
	For better results make sure template image is close 
    in terms of scale and well as rotation/orientation 
    to the object in the scene.

Dependencies include OpenCV (cv2) and NumPy
